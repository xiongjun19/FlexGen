To test GPU and Memory to/from bandwidth test run:
`python main.py`
To perform GPU and NVME to/from bandwidth run the following 
`python run_gds.py`. The output 

If no error the output will be
```python display_gds.py```
```Output saved to output_gds.csv```


To test the bandwidth and latency with respect to CPUs use mlc and stream benchmarks as provided 

```sudo ./run_bandwidth_latency_tests.sh```

please check for the optionts inside the bash script
