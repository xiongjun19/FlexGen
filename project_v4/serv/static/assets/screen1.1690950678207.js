Bespoke Inn, Cafe & Bicycles, Scottsdale, Arizona The four-room boutique Bespoke Inn, Cafe & Bicycles offers a three-course breakfast full of indulgences for every palate. If you have a sweet tooth, try items such as ginger scones with fresh peaches drizzled in local honey or vanilla French toast with toasted almonds, berries, and real maple syrup. For those that prefer a savory start to the morning, tuck into a croque madame with black forest ham and gruyere or asparagus topped with poached eggs, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and parmesan. These breakfasts will set you up for a day of exploring Scottsdale on complimentary Pashley bikes. Starting nightly rate: $259. The New Hotel, Athens Countless affordable restaurants with a tasty breakfast fill the capital city of Greece, but the flaky croissants at New Taste -- the ground-floor restaurant in the New Hotel -- are irresistible. Pastries are baked fresh in-house every morning, filling the restaurant with that just-out-of-the-oven aroma. The bread and pastries are served alongside a refined buffet of fresh fruit, cheeses and meats, along with eggs cooked to order and an espresso bar ready to whip up your favorite morning coffee.

Can a movie really persuade you that "fracking" -- a process used to drill for natural gas -- is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light? Some scoff at the notion that movies do anything more than entertain. They are wrong. Sure, it\'s unlikely that one movie alone will change your views on issues of magnitude. But a movie (or TV show) can begin your "education" or "miseducation" on a topic. And for those already agreeing with the film\'s thesis, it can further entrench your views. Anyone who doubts the potential influence that movies can have on public opinion need to look no further than two films that are causing an uproar even before they have opened nationwide. They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right. The first, "Zero Dark Thirty," is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture. The second, "Promised Land," stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers. Critics of "Zero Dark Thirty" fear that audiences will accept as true the film\'s story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden. They are rightfully concerned that the film will sway some to become more receptive or even supportive of the idea of torturing prisoners. Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden? Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators -- John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein -- sent a letter to the film\'s distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film\'s use of torture as "grossly inaccurate and misleading." The senators bluntly informed Sony Pictures that it has "an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film\'s fictional narrative."',outputText:'Movies have the potential to influence public opinion on controversial topics, sparking debates and shaping views. "Zero Dark Thirty" and "Promised Land" have generated controversy for their portrayal of torture and the environmental risks of fracking, respectively. Critics worry that these films may sway viewers to support torture or question the safety of fracking, highlighting the impact movies can have on shaping perspectives and further entrenching existing beliefs.'},{id:3,inputText:'Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn\'t believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. "He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition," Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He\'d been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn\'t fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. "It took so long," Jordan said.  "It moved so slowly." The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN\'s Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. "He looked good. Hadn\'t lost too much weight. He wasn\'t badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be," he said. Lost at sea for 66 days After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn\'t cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. "I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat," Jordan said.  "The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. "Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket." Then there was the issue of food.',outputText:"A man named Louis Jordan was rescued after being lost at sea for over two months on a damaged sailboat.

The front cover of You magazine shows Semenya after a recent makeover. The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia and The Sun newspaper in Britain reported that gender tests ordered by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) show the 18-year-old is a hermaphrodite. Neither paper named the source of their information. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies would not discuss the findings with CNN. "I simply haven\'t seen the results," Davies said. "We have received the results from Germany, but they now need to be examined by a group of experts and we will not be in a position to speak to the athlete about them for at least a few weeks. "After that, depending on the results, we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action." Has Semenya been treated fairly? The IAAF issued a statement, saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results. A final decision regarding the case is not expected before the IAAF Council meets in late November in Monaco, the IAAF said. Davies also said the news reports should be treated with caution. The newspapers said extensive physical examinations of Semenya show she has no ovaries, but rather has internal testes, which are producing large amounts of testosterone. What is intersexuality? Semenya won the women\'s 800-meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin last month. She crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in 1 minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women\'s time in the world this year. Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver and Jennifer Meadows of Britain claimed bronze.',outputText:"The international governing body for athletics has called for caution regarding reports stating that South African runner Caster Semenya possesses both male and female organs.

The 25-year-old will be competing in her first Olympics at London 2012, where she will play in the women's singles tournament. \"I wasn't aware that I am the first woman but what a personal honor to be representing Russia,\" she told CNN. \"I am grateful for the sincere support from my family, friends and fans from home and across the globe. I'm truly proud and humbled to represent a country that is full of hopes and dreams.\" Sharapova has battled her way back to the top of women's tennis after two years of shoulder problems, returning to No. 1 in the world rankings after completing a career grand slam by winning last month's French Open. She lost top spot to Victoria Azarenka of Belarus this week after a surprise defeat in the fourth round at Wimbledon dropped her to No. 3, but has the chance to make amends as the Olympic event will also be held at the famous grass-court venue. \"This year's upcoming Olympics in London holds special meaning to me as this will be my first foray into the Games,\" Sharapova said. \"It's a remarkable opportunity to not only compete in such a historically prestigious sporting moment, but I am looking forward to sharing this Olympic experience with fellow athletes around the world.\" Sharapova, who will reportedly marry basketball star Sasha Vujacic in November after the end of the tennis season, has been based in the United States for most of her life. She has played three times for Russia's Fed Cup team, all in quarterfinal ties, winning three of her four singles rubbers. Sharapova did not qualify for the 2004 Olympics in Beijing, despite winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old. She missed out in Beijing in 2008 due to injury, and compatriot Elena Dementieva -- who has since retired -- won the women's gold.",outputText:"Maria Sharapova, a tennis star, has been selected as the first woman to carry Russia's flag at the Olympic Games' opening ceremony.

Hogan\'s lawyer said the quotes leaked to a gossip column have been taken out of context and the full article proves Hogan "never condones the O.J. situation."  Watch Hogan claim he was misquoted » A spokesman for Linda Hogan said the statement amounts to a death threat and that her attorney is "weighing all options necessary to protect his client." "His violent and scary mood swings have been my nightmare for too many years," Linda Hogan said Thursday in a written statement. "I hope for the sake of our kids that he gets the psychological help for himself and the safety of others." Her spokesman, Gary Smith, said, "For those who buy his claim the comment was taken out of context, read the rest of Rolling Stone and determine for yourself if his suicidal tendencies coupled with the use of drugs and alcohol make him a danger." The controversial quote is part of a eight-page feature article about Hogan to be published in the magazine\'s Friday edition.

After being fired from the Phoenix hospital, Kwiatkowski went on to work at four more hospitals in four other states. He was arrested this month in New Hampshire in connection with stealing drugs from a hospital, and it\'s believed he infected 30 people in that state with hepatitis C through infected syringes. Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire said it consulted the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists before hiring Kwiatkowski and he held the required certification for his cardiovascular tech position. The registry\'s website says Kwiatkowski\'s certification was "summarily suspended" as of July 2012. Kwiatkowski was working at Arizona Heart Hospital in 2010 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men\'s bathroom, according to documents obtained by CNN. Hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire strikes fear in 7 other states "I looked in the toilet and spotted a 5 cc syringe and a needle floating in the water," the employee said in a statement submitted to the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency. "The label was a blue fentanyl label... He then said \'Shit ... I am going to jail.\'" Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic frequently used in hospitals. Kwiatkowski flushed the syringe and needle down the toilet, according to the employee. Kwiatkowski was immediately fired from Arizona Heart Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. He then relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist. "I don\'t have the resources nor money to fight the accusations," Kwiatkowski wrote at the time. A few weeks later, he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania, and then went on to work in Kansas and Georgia before working in New Hampshire.',outputText:"David Kwiatkowski, the man believed to have infected 30 people with hepatitis C through infected syringes, was fired from an Arizona hospital in 2010 after testing positive for illegal drugs.

Flat World Knowledge stayed busy on campus and now has 40 times as many students and more than 10 times the colleges using their freemium, open-source digital textbooks as they did spring semester. And they did it the old-fashioned way -- one professor at a time. A company is offering digital alternatives to traditional college textbooks. After a sort of beta earlier this year, Flat World was set to announce Thursday that more than 40,000 college students at 400 colleges will use their digital, DRM-free textbooks fall semester, up from 1,000 in 30 colleges in the spring. Digital textbooks remain a nascent business and a tough market to enter. At an average cost of $100, textbooks command the highest cover prices in publishing, outside of only some art and coffee-table books. Demand is artificially inelastic as students are indentured to cost servitude at the whim of college professors who blithely assign titles a student must own if she hopes to do well in a given course. Now, multiply that by four, five or even six courses a semester and you are talking big bucks. By comparison, Flat World has a pricing scheme that starts at zero for online access using a browser, and $20 for a PDF, which they believe will be the most popular format. Printed versions of their textbooks cost up to $60. Perhaps best of all: Textbooks are available a la carte, chapter by chapter. But the key buy-in has been from teachers who make the assignments and who, in my college days, could not care less how much the textbooks cost. What's changed? \"There has been a mind shift,\" co-founder Eric Frank told Wired.com. A tipping point came a couple of years ago when faculty began to consider the financial burden on students because many of them (Frank estimates a third) didn't bother to get the textbook at all.",outputText:"Flat World Knowledge, a company offering digital alternatives to traditional college textbooks, has experienced significant growth with over 40,000 students at 400 colleges using their freemium, open-source digital textbooks for the fall semester, compared to 1,000 students at 30 colleges in the spring.

Gardephe ruled last month against Gaga's lawyer's request that the case be dismissed. In her lawsuit, Jennifer O'Neill says that she worked \"24/7\" as Gaga's personal assistant. O'Neill was employed in early 2009, and again from February 2010 to March 2011. After she was rehired, she was told her annual salary would be $75,000. \"Every day is a work day for her, so every day is a work day for the rest of us,\" O'Neill said, according to court documents. \"There is no, we're going to stay in, we're going to sleep. There is no, let's put on sweatpants and go out to the movies and be girlfriends. It doesn't work like that.\" Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, testified that O'Neill \"deserves every one of her $75,000 that we agreed to. But she does not deserve a penny more.\" CNN's Carolyn Sung, Rachel Wells and Susan Candiotti contributed this report. @highlight Details of the deal were not revealed in court papers filed to end the case @highlight A trial had been set for trial in New York next week @highlight The former personal assistant sought $350,000 in back pay from Lady Gaga @highlight Jennifer O'Neill claimed she worked \"24/7\" for Gaga Lady Gaga has reached a confidential settlement with her former assistant who sued her for unpaid overtime.

Beat Germany, or at least eke out a tie, and the Americans go through to the knockout stage. Lose, and they open themselves up to the possibility that their World Cup 2014 run ends in the group stage. That's one of five things we'll be watching for and talking about Thursday: 1. NOTE FROM THE BOSS Could be quiet in the office First came the trash talk between Germany and the United States -- at the United Nations, of all places! Now Team USA's German-born coach Jurgen Klinsmann is trying to rally fans stateside. The game starts at noon ET, right in the middle of the workday, so Klinsmann tweeted a form letter for employees to give their bosses. \"I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause,\" Klinsmann deadpanned. Between Klinsmann's own account and that of the U.S. men's national team, it was retweeted nearly 40,000 times in the first six hours after the coach tweeted it. 2. WILL FIFA BITE BACK? Clock ticking on Suarez He bit a guy four years ago and got banned for seven matches. He bit a guy last year and got banned for 10. And now world-class striker Luis Suarez is accused of biting another guy Tuesday during Uruguay's vital match against Italy. He went face-first into Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder late in the match, no question. But were his fangs out? Chiellini yanked his shirt down to show what he says are tooth marks. Suarez responded that it was just a normal collision. Now world soccer's governing body is deciding what happened. If it rules that Suarez did bite Chiellini, it could ban him for up to two years. The decision is due Thursday.",outputText:"Team USA's fate in the World Cup depends on their match against Germany, where a win or tie will secure their spot in the knockout stage.
